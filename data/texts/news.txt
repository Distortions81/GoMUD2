April 25th - May 2nd 2024 Changelog (129 commits):
Threaded networking, ANSI color with styles,
telnet commands, mud client detection, unicode support,
character map negotiation, character map translation, accounts,
characters, fast-relog (logout), reconnect to 'already playing'
characters, passphrase generation, passphrase scoring, threaded
input buffering with flooding-kick, basic new character name checks,
accounts/character names/passphrases support unicode, high security
passphrase hashing, support for TLS/SSL secure connections,
account/character unique fingerprint IDs, basic say/who/quit commands.

May 2th - 4th (35 commits):
Added login menu idle kick and in-game idle kick. Rewrote ANSI color
system. Added basic help file system (see help ansi). Fixed some
relog/reconnect bugs. Added (no link) to who command to show player
lost connection. Fixed a minor race condition with link loss. New
passphrase hashing (encrypt) was rewritten to be asynchronous
(on it's own cpu thread) and limited (queue, one at a time).
This prevents a small lag hitch for the rest of the mud when
a new account is created.
